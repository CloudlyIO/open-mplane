yang-models

This directory contains classes corresponding to individual YANG models.

The contents were copied from the fb-oru implementation, and it is indicated in
comments that they were auto-generated, but we do not have the generation tools.

Currently, the classes themselves are only used for their IDs, names, and file
names. The rest of the class contents are unused.
